# Quantum Validator

A TypeScript library for validating quantum field measurements and physical quantities with dimensional analysis.

## Overview

The Quantum Validator provides a robust system for validating physical measurements in quantum systems, ensuring that values respect physical limits and dimensional consistency. It includes:

- Physical dimension tracking using SI base units
- Unit conversion and validation
- Quantum field measurement validation
- Built-in physical constants and limits

## Features

### Physical Dimensions

- Support for all seven SI base dimensions:
  - Mass [M]
  - Length [L]
  - Time [T]
  - Electric Current [I]
  - Temperature [Θ]
  - Amount of Substance [N]
  - Luminous Intensity [J]
- Dimensional analysis for operations between physical quantities
- Human-readable dimension formatting with proper notation (e.g., [M]¹[L]²[T]⁻³)

### Physical Quantities

- Mathematical operations between compatible quantities
- Automatic unit conversion
- Range validation against physical limits
- Support for common physical units

### Measurement Validation

- Electric field component validation
- Total field strength calculation
- Dimensional consistency checks
- Detailed validation error reporting

Summary of the Diagram
Quantum Field Validator: The central component performing real-time validation of quantum field measurements.
Physical Dimensions System: Manages SI unit base support and dimensional analysis essential for physical measurement operations.
Quantum Constants: Holds necessary constants for quantum calculations, like Planck's constant.
Physical Limits: Enforces constraints on environmental parameters like electric/magnetic fields and temperature.

const validator = new EnhancedMeasurementValidator()

// Validate quantum field components
const measurement = {
  Ex: 1000,  // V/m
  ExUnit: "V/m",
  Ey: 1200,  // V/m
  EyUnit: "V/m",
  Ez: 800,   // V/m
  EzUnit: "V/m"
}

const validationResults = validator.validateQuantumField(measurement)
